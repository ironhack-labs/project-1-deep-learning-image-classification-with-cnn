# Best Model Selection

## Selected Model: Custom CNN
The Custom CNN model was chosen as the best model for this project based on the following observations:

1. **Test Accuracy**: Achieved 71%, outperforming the VGG16 model (62%).
2. **Performance**: Demonstrated better generalization across all classes.
3. **Simplicity**: The custom model is less complex and computationally efficient compared to VGG16.

## Future Considerations
While the Custom CNN is the best for this project, future improvements could involve:
- Fine-tuning more layers in the VGG16 model.
- Exploring other pre-trained architectures like ResNet or MobileNet.
